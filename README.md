# Simple Eats

## About the Project
This project was built collaboratively by three prospective coders at the UNCC Coding Bootcamp. This project allows a user to find recipes and filter results based on dietary restrictions, excluded ingredients, food intolerances, and types of food/drink. Users can add items from a recipe's ingredient list directly to a grocery list. 

## Styling

This website was built with materialize: https://materializecss.com/

The initial skeleton for the website was built using the following template: https://materializecss.com/templates/parallax-template/preview.html
